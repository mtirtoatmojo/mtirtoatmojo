 # 👋 Hi, I’m Michelle Tirtoatmojo! 
I'm an aspiring leader, entrepreneur, and a heartfelt data storyteller! I believe that data has the transformative power to drive impactful decisions in executing various business strategy and operations. 
This belief stemmed from my previous experiences working in tech consulting and venture capital. I'm now transitioning to work in strategy & business operations or product analytics! 

- 🌱 I'm deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and learning about Bayesian statistics 
- 🖥 I graduated from UCLA with a degree in International Development & Development Economics and is currently pursuing an MS in Applied Analytics at Columbia University
- ✨ I'm also an avid yogi where I’ve got my teacher training certification in 2022 from the Yoga Alliance
